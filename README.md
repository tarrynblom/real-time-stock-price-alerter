## üîß Implementation Details

### Data Pipeline

1. **Fetch**: Retrieve intraday stock data via REST API
2. **Clean**: Process timestamps and extract closing prices
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create lagged price features for time-series prediction
4. **Predict**: Use trained model to forecast next price point
5. **Alert**: Compare prediction with current price and trigger alerts

### Machine Learning Model

- **Type**: Linear Regression (optimized for interpretability and performance)
- **Features**: Engineered time-series features including lagged price movements
- **Target**: Real-time stock price prediction
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive accuracy metrics with directional prediction analysis

### Alerting Logic

```python
def should_alert(current_price, predicted_price, threshold=0.01):
    """
    Trigger alert if predicted price differs by more than threshold
    """
    price_change = abs(predicted_price - current_price) / current_price
    return price_change > threshold
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from stock_alerter import StockAlerter

# Initialize with your preferred stock symbol
alerter = StockAlerter('AAPL')

# Fetch data and train model
alerter.fetch_data()
alerter.train_model()

# Get prediction and check for alerts
prediction = alerter.predict_next_price()
if alerter.should_alert(prediction):
    print(f"Alert: Predicted price change for AAPL: {prediction}")
```

### API Endpoint

```bash
# Trigger prediction for a specific stock
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/predict/AAPL"

# Get current model performance
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/model/stats"
```
